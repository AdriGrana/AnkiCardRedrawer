# AnkiCardRedrawer

## Overview

This addon introduces the ability to redraw cards during Anki review sessions with a keyboard shortcut (default **Shift+Q**) or by clicking a button on the bottom of the card. It's particularly useful when used alongside the Randomize Fonts addon, allowing for the card to be redrawn to display in a different random font. While the primary design is for font randomization, the addon can be helpful in any situation where redrawing a card during reviews might be beneficial.

## Features

- **Redraw with Shortcut or Button**: Redraw your current review card either with the press of a keyboard shortcut or by clicking the redraw button, aimed at refreshing how the information is presented.
- **Complements Randomize Fonts Addon**: Best used with the Randomize Fonts addon for changing the card's font randomly upon redraw, though not limited to this use.
- **Useful for Various Scenarios**: Designed with font randomization in mind but applicable for any case where a card redraw could be useful during reviews.
- **Review Session Specific**: The feature is available during review sessions only, not in the card browser (with potential for future updates to expand its use).
- **Customizable Shortcut**: The shortcut for redrawing can be changed in Anki's **Tools -> Add-ons** menu.
- **Statistics Note**: Redrawing a card restarts its timer, which could slightly affect statistics.

## Compatibility

Tested with the latest Anki version at the time of writing (23:12:1). Performance with older versions may vary.

## Installation and Configuration

- **Installation**: Install the addon from Anki's **Add-ons** menu using this code 237959110. See here for more information: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/237959110?cb=1728064460891

## Usage

Press the default shortcut (**Shift+Q**) or click the redraw button during a review session to redraw the current card. This feature is especially handy if you're using the Randomize Fonts addon and want to see the card in a different font without impacting your review statistics.

# AnkiCardRedrawer
Overview
This addon introduces the ability to redraw cards during Anki review sessions with a keyboard shortcut (default Shift+Q). It's particularly useful when used alongside the Randomize Fonts addon, allowing for the card to be redrawn to display in a different random font. While the primary design is for font randomization, the addon can be helpful in any situation where redrawing a card during reviews might be beneficial.

Features
Redraw with Shortcut: Redraw your current review card with the press of a keyboard shortcut, aimed at refreshing how the information is presented.
Complements Randomize Fonts Addon: Best used with the Randomize Fonts addon for changing the card's font randomly upon redraw, though not limited to this use.
Useful for Various Scenarios: Designed with font randomization in mind but applicable for any case where a card redraw could be useful during reviews.
Review Session Specific: The feature is available during review sessions only, not in the card browser (with potential for future updates to expand its use).
Customizable Shortcut: The shortcut for redrawing can be changed in Anki's Tools -> Add-ons menu.
Statistics Note: Redrawing a card restarts its timer, which could slightly affect statistics.
Compatibility
Tested with the latest Anki version at the time of writing (23:12:1). Performance with older versions may vary.

Installation and Configuration
Installation: Install the addon from Anki's Add-ons menu using its code or name.
Changing the Shortcut: To change the redraw shortcut, go to Anki's Tools -> Add-ons menu, select the Redraw Cards addon, and click on "Config".
Usage
Press the default shortcut (Shift+Q) during a review session to redraw the current card. This feature is especially handy if you're using the Randomize Fonts addon and want to see the card in a different font without impacting your review statistics.

Future Updates
Future updates may extend the addon's functionality to other parts of Anki, like the card browser. Keep an eye out for updates.
